CRC code
----
This code is written using  Python
--> it reads an input file (input.txt) with the message and fn generator
-->it makes long division on them and outputs the transmitted message
--> verifier checks that the transmitted message is correct
--> you choose an index to alter the message with
           (left most bit is index 1)
--> it alters the bit , sends it to the verifier to check if it's a correct transmitted message or not 
--> output file (result.txt) is generated with all the results
